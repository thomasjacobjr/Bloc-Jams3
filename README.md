Created by Thomas Jacob Jr. at [Bloc](http://bloc.io)

## Introduction 

Bloc Jams is a work-in-progress Javascript and HTML/CSS project that replicates a 
fully-functional music catalogue and playback website. No database of music
exists within the application yet, but many Javascript features are included.
Have a look around :-) 

## Installation 

Simply clone or download the repo, then run `bundle install` from the command line.
All files and gems are included with the project.

To run the project locally, run `rails server` in the command line and navigate
your browser to localhost:3000.
